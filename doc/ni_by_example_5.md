#Future Chapter 5 Below


## Understanding the `ni` monitor

At this point, you've probably executed a long-running enough `ni` job to see the `ni` monitor appear at the top of your screen. 

* Negative numbers = non-rate-determining step
* Positive numbers = rate-determining step
* Large Positive numbers = slow step

Some things to keep in mind when examining the output of the monitor: if you have access to more compute resources for slow steps, you can use them for that step alone, and this can be done in a very simple way via the `S` horizontal scaling operator.

You may also want to consider refactoring your job to make use of Hadoop Streaming with `HS`, depending on what's suited to your job. More details are available in the [monitor docs](monitor.md) and in the [optimization docs](optimization.md).


## Even More Perl for Ni

### `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`

### `p'... END { }'`: END Block

Similar to a BEGIN block, and END block is used to calculate totals from the data that has accumulated in persistent variables.

```bash
$ ni n5p'^{@x}; push @x, 2*a; undef; END{r join " and ", @x}'
2 and 4 and 6 and 8 and 10
```

We accumulate all of the values in `x`, then join them together and return them all. The statement `undef` is added to make the perl mapper be quiet while it is accumulating values (otherwise, the return value of `push` is the length of the output array).

### `our` and `local`



### `use strict` and the `::` prefix within `p'...'`

When `use strict` is enabled, Perl will complain when you try to create a variable in a Perl snippet that does not start with `::`.

The reasons for this are very specific to Perl; if you are a true Perl nerd, you can look them up, but you do not need to know them if you just accept that variables need to start with `::` when you apply `use strict`. 

It is probably a good idea to `use strict` when the variables you define are sufficiently complex; otherwise you're probably okay not using it.


### Subroutines

Perl is a multi-paradigm language, but the dominant paradigm for Perl within `ni` is procedural programming. Unlike the object-oriented languages with which you are likely familiar, where methods are objects (often "first-class" objects, [whatever that means](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/245192/what-are-first-class-objects)) procedural languages focus on their functions, called "subroutines."  

Perl subroutines store the variables with which they are called in a default variable named `@_`. Before continuing, take a moment to think about how one would refer the elements in `@_`.

Subroutines are stored and referenced with the following syntax:

```
*x = sub {"hi"}
$v = &x         # $v will be set to "hi"
```


Here's how you'd write a function that copies a stream of values 4 times in `ni`, using Perl.

```bash
$ ni n3p'*v = sub {$_[0] x 4}; &v(a)'
1111
2222
3333
```

To review the syntax, the *name* of the variable is `_`, and within the body of the subroutine, the array associated with that name, `@_` is the array of values that are passed to the function.  To get any particular scalar value within `@_`, you tell Perl you want a scalar (`$`) from the variable with name `_`, and then indicate to Perl that of the variables named `_`, you want to reference the array, by using the postfix `[0]`.

Subroutines can also be called without the preceding `&`, or created using the following syntax:

```bash
$ ni 1p'sub yo {"hi " . $_[0]} yo a'
hi 1
```

Note that in these examples, a new function will be defined for every line in the input, which is highly inefficient. In the next section, we will introduce begin blocks, which allow functions to be defined once and then used over all of the lines in a Perl mapper block.

##Data Development with `ni` and Hadoop

If you screw up your partitioning, you're ruined. 

JSON => Raw TSV => Cleaned TSV => Filtered TSV => Joined TSV => Statistics

If there's a potential problem with a column, you cannot use it as the first column in a reduce. If you do, Hadoop is very unforgiving; you'll end up having to bail on a particular slice of your data, or restart from the last nearly-equally-partitioned step.

Let's say you have data with 3 columns: `user_id`, `geohash`, `timestamp`. 

It's likely that both some of the users and some of the geohashes are spurious.  This will cause us difficulty down the line, for example when we want to join data to each record using geohash as the joining key.

### `:checkpoint_name[...]`: Checkpoints

Developing and deploying to producion `ni` pipelines that involve multiple Hadoop streaming steps involves a risk of failure outside the programmer's control; when this happens, we don't want to have to run the entire job again. 

Checkpoints allow you to save the results of difficult jobs while continuing to develop in `ni`.

Checkpoints and files share many commonalities. The key difference between a checkpoint and a file are:

1. A checkpoint will wait for an `EOF` before writing to the specified checkpoint name, so the data in a checkpoint file will consist of all the output of the operator it encloses. A file, on the other hand, will accept all output that is streamed in, with no guarantee that it is complete.
2. If you run a `ni` pipeline with checkpoints, and there are files that correspond to the checkpoint names in the directory from which `ni` is being run, then `ni` will use the data in the checkpoints in place of running the job. This allows you to save the work of long and expensive jobs, and to run these jobs multiple times without worrying that bhe steps earlier in the pipeline that have succeeded will have to be re-run.

An example of checkpoint use is the following:

```bash
$ ni nE6gr4 :numbers
1
10
100
1000
```

This computation will take a while, because `g` requires buffering to disk; However, this result has been checkpointed, thus more instuctions can be added to the command without requiring a complete re-run.


```bash
$ ni nE6gr4 :numbers O
1000
100
10
1
```

Compare this to the same code writing to a file:

```
$ ni nE6gr4 =\>numbers
1000
100
10
1
```

Because the sort is not checkpointed, adding to the command is not performant, and everything must be recomputed.

```
$ ni nE6gr4 =\>numbers O
1000
100
10
1
```

One caveat with checkpoint files is that they are persisted, so these files must be cleared between separate runs of `ni` pipelines to avoid collisions. Luckily, if you're using checkpoints to do your data science, errors like these will come out fast and should be obvious.


### Developing Hadoop Streaming pipelines with checkpoints

As of now, `ni` auto-generates the names for the Hadoop directories, and these can be hard to remember off the top of your head. If you want to 


###Tools for Data Development

1. A good markdown editor; I like Laverna, and it should work on basically all platforms.
2. Infinite patience
3. A reasonable test set.

##Partitioned Matrix Operations

Operations on huge matrices are not entirely `ni`ic, since they may require space greater than memory, whichwill make them slow. However, operators are provided to improve These operations are suited best to 


* `X<col>`, `Y<col>`, `N<col>`: Matrix Partitioning
  * **TODO**: understand how these actually work.
* `X`: sparse-to-dense transformation
  * In the case that there are collisions for locations `X`, `X` will sum the values
  * For example: `ni n010p'r 0, a%3, 1' X`

##Binary Operations
In theory, this can save you a lot of space. But I haven't used this in practice.
