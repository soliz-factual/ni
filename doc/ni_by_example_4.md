##Intermediate Column Operations
We can weave together row, column, and Perl operations to create more complex row operations. We also introduce some more advanced column operators.

* `w`: Append column to stream
  * `$ ni <data> w[np'a*a']`
  * `w` will add columns only up to the length of the input stream
* `W`: Prepend column stream
  * `$ ni <data> Wn` - Add line numbers to the stream (by prepending one element the infinite stream `n`)
  * `W` will add rows only up to the length of the input stream
* `v`: Vertical operation on columns
  * **Important Note**: As of 2016-12-23, this operator is too slow to use in production.
  
##Advanced Row and Column Operations
* `j` - streaming join
  * Note that this join will consume a single line of both streams; it does **NOT** provide a SQL-style left or right join.
* `Y` - dense-to-sparse transformation
  * Explodes each row of the stream into several rows, each with three columns:
    * The index of the row that the input data that came from
    * The index of the column that the input data came from
    * The value of the input stream at the row + column specified by the first two columns.
* `X` - sparse-to-dense transformation
  * `X` inverts `Y`; it converts a specifically-formatted 3-column stream into a multiple-column stream.
  * The specification for what the input matrix must look like is described above in the `Y` operator.
  
  

##Things other than Perl 

Look, these are here, and if it helps you get started with `ni`, great. But `ni` is written in Perl, for Perl, and in a Perlic style. Use these, but go learn Perl.

*  `m'<...>'`: Ruby
   * applies the Ruby snippet `<...>` to each row of the stream 
*  `l'<...>'`: Lisp
   * applies the Lisp snippet `<...>` to each row of the stream 

##Understanding the `ni` monitor
More details [here](monitor.md). Overall:

* Negative numbers = non-rate-determining step
* Positive numbers = rate-determining step
* Large Positive numbers = slow step

##Cell Operations 
`$ ni <data> ,<op><columns>`

These provide keystroke-efficient ways to do transformations on a single column of the input data. Of particular use is the deterministic hashing function, which does a good job of compacting long IDs into 32-bit integers. With ~40 million IDs, there will be only be about 1% hash collisions, and with 400 million IDs, there will be 10% hash collisions.  See [this](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35791/birthday-problem-expected-number-of-collisions) for why.

* `,a`: Running average
* `,d`: Difference between consecutive rows
* `,e`: Natural exponential (`e**x`)
* `,h`: Murmurhash (deterministic 32-bit hash function)
* `,j<amt>`: Jitter (add uniform random noise in the range `[-amt/2, amt/2]`)
* `,l`: Natural log (`ln x`)
* `,s`: Running sum 
* `,q`: Quantize
* `,z`: Intify (hash and then convert hash values to integers starting with 1)



##Connecting `bash` and `ni`

* `e[<script>]`: Evaluate script
  * evaluate `<script>` in bash, and stream out the results one line at a time.


##More Perl for `ni`
A few important operators for doing data manipulation in Perl. Many Perl subroutines can be written without parentheses or unquoted directly in to `ni` scripts. Go look these up in docs online until something more substantial is written here.

* `lc`
* `uc`
* `substr`
* `split`
* `join`
* `**`: exponent
* `my $<v> = <expr>`: instantiate a scalar `<v>` with the value of `<expr>`
* `map`
* `keys %h`
* Regular Expressions
  * `$<v> =~ /regex/`
  * `$<v> =~ s/regex//`
  * `$<v> = tr/regex//d`
  * `$<v> = y/regex//`




##Useful `ni`-specific Perl Subroutines
The operators in this section refer specifically to the 
`$ ni <data> p'...'`

* `ghe`: geohash encoding
  * `ghe($lat, $lng, $precision)`
    * If `$precision > 0`, returns a geohash with `$precision` base-32 characters of precision. 
    * If `$precision < 0`, returns a geohash with `$precision` (base-2) bits of precision.
* `ghd`: geohash decoding
  * `ghd($gh_base32)`
     * Returns the corresponding latitude and longitude (in that order) of the southwesternmost point corresponding to that geohash.
  * `ghd($gh_int, $precision)`
    * If the number of bits of precision is specified, `ghd` will decode the input integer as a geohash with $precision bits. Returns the  latitude and longitude (in that order) of the southwesternmost point corresponding to that geohash.
* `tpe`: time parts to epoch
  * `tpe(@time_pieces)`: Returns the epoch time and assumes that the pieces are year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, in that order.
  * `tpe($time_format, @time_pieces)`: Returns the epoch time, using `$time_format` to determine what the ordered `@time_pieces` are.
* `tep`: time epoch to parts
  * `tep($epoch_time)`: returns the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second in human-readable formatfrom the epoch time.
  * `tep($time_format, $epoch_time)`: returns the specified parts of the date using following `$time_format`.
* `timezone_seconds`
  * `tep($raw_timestamp + $timezone_seconds($lat, $lng))` returns the approximate date and time at the location `$lat, $lng` at a Unix timestamp of `$raw_timestamp`.

**TODO**: Say something useful.


##Custom Compound Reduce
#### `rfn`: Custom compound reduce

**TODO: Understand this**

##Matrix Operations

Operations on huge matrices are not entirely `ni`ic, since they may require space greater than memory, whichwill make them slow. However, operators are provided to improve These operations are suited best to 


* `X<col>`, `Y<col>`, `N<col>`: Matrix Partitioning
  * **TODO**: understand how these actually work.
* `X`: sparse-to-dense transformation
  * In the case that there are collisions for locations `X`, `X` will sum the values
  * For example: `ni n010p'r 0, a%3, 1' X`

##Disk-Backed Data Closures

* `@:[disk_backed_data_closure]`

##Annoyingly Advanced Perl
* `use strict` and the `::` prefix in a Perl Environment
  * When `use strict` is enabled, Perl will complain when you try to create a variable in a Perl snippet that does not start with `::`.
  * The reasons for this are very specific to Perl; if you are a true Perl nerd, you can look them up, but you do not need to know them if you just accept that variables need to start with `::` when you apply `use strict`.
  * It is probably a good idea to `use strict` when the variables you define are sufficiently complex; otherwise you're probably okay not using it.
  
##Binary Operations
In theory, this can save you a lot of space. But I haven't used this in practice.
  

##Less Useful `ni`-specific Perl Extensions


###Array Functions
  * `clip`
  * `within`
  
##Stream Splitting/Joining/Duplication
I don't find these operators particularly useful in practice (with the exception of `=\>` for writing a file in the middle of a long processing pipeline), but it's possible that you will! Then come edit these docs and explain why.

* `+`: append a stream to this one
* `^`: prepend a stream to this one
* `=`: duplicate this stream through a process, discarding its output
