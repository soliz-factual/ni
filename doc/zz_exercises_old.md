Learning a programming language, like any language, is difficult without the opportunity for structured practice.

##Stream Operators

Write three `ni` snippets to compute the first 100 triangular numbers (1,3,6,10,15...)

1. Use a ni stream operator to generate a range, then use a perl snippet and the formula `T_n = n*(n+1)/2`
2. Use a ni stream operator to generate a range, then use a perl snippet to generate two columns of data; then write another perl snippet that combines the two columns appropriately to generate the ouput numbers.
3. Write a different solution from #1 and #2
