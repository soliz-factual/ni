# `ni` by Example, Chapter 3

## Introduction

In this section, we introduce `ni`-specific Perl extensions. 
`ni` was developed at [Factual, Inc.](www.factual.com), which works with mobile location data; these geographically-oriented operators are open-sourced and highly efficient. There's also a [blog post](https://www.factual.com/blog/how-geohashes-work) if you're interested in learning more.

The next set of operators work with multiple lines of input data; this allows reductions over multiple lines to take place. This section ends with a discussion of more I/O functions.


## `ni`-specific Perl Functions

### Geographic Perl Functions

#### `ghe`: geohash encoding
Geohashes are an efficient way of encoding a position on the globe, and is also useful for determining neighboring locations.

The geohashing algorithm works by splitting first on longitude, then by latitude. Thus, geohashes with an odd number of binary bits of precision will be (approximately) squares, and geohashes with an even number of digits will be (approximately) rectangles with their longer side parallel to the equator.

base-32 characters | Approximate geohash size
--- |  ----
1 | 5,000km x 5,000km
2 | 1,250km x 625km
3 | 160km x 160km
4 | 40km x 20km
5 | 5km x 5km
6 | 1.2km x 600m
7 | 150m x 150m
8 | 40m x 20m
9 | 5m x 5m
10 | 1.2m x 60cm
11 | 15cm x 15cm
12 | 4cm x 2cm

`ghe($lat, $lng, $precision)` returns either a geohash in a special base-32 alphabet, or as a long integer.

If `$precision > 0`, the geohash is specified with `$precison` base-32 characters. When geohashes are specified in this way, they are referred to in short as `gh<$precision>`, for example gh6, gh8, or gh12. If `$precision < 0`, it returns an integer geohash with `-$precision` bits of precision.

Examples:

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe(a, b, 7)'
9q5cc25
```

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe(a, b, -35)'
10407488581
```

The default is to encode with 12 base-32 characters, i.e. a gh12, or 60 bits of precision.

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe(a, b)'
9q5cc25twby7
```

The parentheses are also often unnecessary, because of the prototypin:

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe a, b, 9'
9q5cc25tw
```

#### `ghd`: geohash decoding

`ni` provides two prototypes for geohash decoding:

`ghd($gh_base32)` Returns the corresponding latitude and longitude (in that order) of the center point corresponding to that geohash.

`ghd($gh_int, $precision)` decodes the input integer as a geohash with `$precision` bits and returns the  latitude and longitude (in that order) of the center point corresponding to that geohash.  As with `ghe`, parentheses are not always necessary.

Examples:

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'r ghd ghe a, b'
34.058565851301	-118.416526280344
```

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'r ghd ghe(a, b, -41), 41'
34.0584754943848	-118.416652679443
```

#### `ghb`: geohash bounding box

For plotting, it is useful to get the latitude and longitude coordinates of  the box that is mapped to a particular geohash. `ghb` returns the coordinates of that box in order: northernmost point, southernmost point, easternmost point, westernmost point.

```bash
$ ni 1p'r ghb "95qc"'
18.6328123323619	18.45703125	-125.156250335276	-125.5078125
```

#### `gh_dist`: distance between geohash centroids
It is also useful to compute the distance between the center points of geohashes; this is implemented through `gh_dist`.

```bash
$ ni 1p'gh_dist "95qcc25y", "95qccdnv", mi'
1.23981551084308
```

When the units are not specified, `gh_dist` gives its answers in kilometers, which can be specified explicitly as "km". Other options include feet ("ft") and meters ("m"). To specify meters, you will need to use quotation marks, as the bareword `m` is taken.

```bash
$ ni 1p'gh_dist "95qcc25y", "95qccdnv"'
1.99516661267524
```


#### `lat_lon_dist`: distance between points on the globe
This subroutine implements the haversine distance formula. Like `gh_dist`, it also takes units ("mi", "km", "ft", "m"), and will return the distance in kilometers if no other information is given.

```bash
$ ni 1p'lat_lon_dist 31.21984, 121.41619, 34.058686, -118.416762'
10426.7380460312
```


### Time Perl Functions

`tpe` and `tep` are the most flexible and powerful time functions in `ni`'s arsenal for converting between Unix timestamps and date. Other important functions here are used for localization by lat/long or geohash, and several syntactic sugars are provided for common mathematical and semntic time operations.

    
#### `tpe`: time parts to epoch
`tpe(@time_pieces)`: Returns the epoch time in GMT (see important note below)
and assumes that the pieces are year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, 
in that order. 

```bash
$ ni 1p'tpe(2017, 1, 22, 8, 5, 13)'
1485072313
```

You can also specify a format string and call the function as `tpe($time_format, @time_pieces)`.

```bash
$ ni 1p'tpe("mdYHMS", 1, 22, 2017, 8, 5, 13)'
1485072313
```

#### `tep`: time epoch to parts

`tep($epoch_time)`: returns the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second in human-readable format from the epoch time.

```bash
$ ni 1p'r tep tpe 2017, 1, 22, 8, 5, 13'
2017	1	22	8	5	13
```

A specific format string can also be provided, in which case `tep` is called as `tep($time_format, $epoch_time)`.

#### `tsec`: approximately convert epoch to local time

`tep($raw_timestamp + tsec($lat, $lng))` returns the approximate date and time at the location `$lat, $lng` at a Unix timestamp of `$raw_timestamp`.

For example, let's say you have the Unix timestamp and want to know what time it is at the coordinates: 34.058566<sup>0</sup> N, 118.416526<sup>0</sup> W.

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'my $epoch_time = 1485079513; my $tz_offset = tsec(a, b); my @local_time_parts = tep($epoch_time + $tz_offset); r @local_time_parts'
2017	1	22	2	41	13
```

This correction cuts the globe into 4-minute strips by degree of longitude.
It is meant for approximation of local time, not the actual time, which depends much more on politics and introduces many more factors to think about.

#### `ghl` and `gh6l`: approximate conversion to local time from geohash/gh60 

`ghl` and `gh6l` get local time from an input geohash input in base-32 (`ghl`) or base-10 representation of a the geohash-60 in binary (`gh6l`).

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe a, b' p'my $epoch_time = 1485079513; my @local_time_parts = tep ghl($epoch_time, a); r @local_time_parts'
2017	1	22	2	41	13
```

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe a, b, -60' p'my $epoch_time = 1485079513; my @local_time_parts = tep gh6l($epoch_time, a); r @local_time_parts'
2017	1	22	2	41	13
```


#### `i2e` and `e2i`: ISO 8601 time <=> epoch time

ISO 8601 is a standardized time format defined by the International Organization for Standards. More information on formats is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). `ni` implements decoding for date-time-timezone formatted ISO data into Unix timestamps.

```bash
$ ni i2017-06-24T18:23:47+00:00 i2017-06-24T19:23:47+01:00 i2017-06-24T15:23:47-03:00 i2017-06-24T13:08:47-05:15 i20170624T152347-0300 i20170624T182347Z p'i2e a'
1498328627
1498328627
1498328627
1498328627
1498328627
1498328627
```

`ni` can also format epoch timestamps in an ISO 8601-compatible form. To do this, input an epoch timestamp and either a floating number of hours, or a timezone format string, for example `"+10:00"`.

```bash
$ ni i2017-06-24T18:23:47+00:00 p'i2e a' p'r e2i a; r e2i a, -1.5; r e2i a, "+3"; r e2i a, "-05:45"'
2017-06-24T18:23:47Z
2017-06-24T16:53:47-01:30
2017-06-24T21:23:47+03:00
2017-06-24T12:38:47-05:45
```

These all represent the same instant:

```bash
$ ni i2017-06-24T18:23:47+00:00 p'i2e a' p'r e2i a; r e2i a, -1.5; r e2i a, "+3"; r e2i a, "-05:45"' p'i2e a'
1498328627
1498328627
1498328627
1498328627
```


#### `dow`, `hod`, `how`, `ym`: Day-of-Week, Hour-of-Day, Hour-of-Week, Year-and-Month shorthands

These functions give the 3-letter abbreviation for day of week, hour of day, and hour of week, and year + month.

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe a, b, -60' p'my $epoch_time = 1485079513; dow gh6l($epoch_time, a) '
Sun
```

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe a, b, -60' p'my $epoch_time = 1485079513; hod gh6l($epoch_time, a)'
2
```

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe a, b, -60' p'my $epoch_time = 1485079513; how gh6l($epoch_time, a)'
Sun_02
```

```bash
$ ni i[34.058566 -118.416526] p'ghe a, b, -60' p'my $epoch_time = 1485079513; ym gh6l($epoch_time, a)'
2017_01
```

#### `ttd`, `tth`, `tt15`, `ttm`: truncate to day, hour, quarter-hour, and minute

These functions truncate dates, which is useful for bucketing times; they're much faster than calls to the POSIX library, which can make them more practical in performance-environments (`HS`, for example).

```bash
$ ni i1494110651 p'r tep ttd(a); r tep tth(a); r tep tt15(a); r tep ttm(a); r tep a'
2017	5	6	0	0	0
2017	5	6	22	0	0
2017	5	6	22	30	0
2017	5	6	22	44	0
2017	5	6	22	44	11
```

#### `ctd`, `cth`, `ct15`, `ctm`: clip to day, hour, quarter-hour, and minute

This can be used to save time and space, especially when running Hadoop jobs that require carrying around timestamps.

```bash
$ ni i1494110651 p'r ctd(a), cth(a), ct15(a), ctm(a), a'
17292	415030	1660122	24901844	1494110651
```

#### `itd`, `ith`, `it15`, `itm`: inflate to day, hour, quarter-hour, and minute

Undoes the clipping operation; the result of clipping followed by inflation is equivalent to the truncation operation. Separating the two options in time saves space (at the expense of more computation).

```bash
$ ni i1494110651 p'r ctd(a), cth(a), ct15(a), ctm(a), a' p'r itd a, ith b, it15 c, itm d, e'
1494028800	1494108000	1494109800	1494110640	1494110651
```

```bash
$ ni i1494110651 p'r ttd(a), tth(a), tt15(a), ttm(a), a'
1494028800	1494108000	1494109800	1494110640	1494110651
```

## Buffered Readahead and Multiline Selection

So far, we have only seen many ways to operate on data, but only one way to reduce it, the counting operator `c`. Buffered readahead allows us to perform operations on many lines at onceThese operations are used to convert columnar data into arrays of lines.  

### `rl`, `rw`, `ru`, `re`: Buffered Readahead

In general, the types of reductions that can be done with buffered readahead and multiline reducers can also be done with streaming reduce (discussed in a later chapter); however, the syntax for  buffered readahead is often much simpler. Generating arrays of lines using readahead operations is a common motif in `ni` scripts:

* `rl(n)`: read `n` lines
  * `@lines = rl(n)`: `n` is optional, and if it is not given, only one line will be read.
* `rw`: read while
  * `@lines = rw {condition}`: read lines while a condition is met
* `ru`: read until
  * `@lines = ru {condition}`: read lines until a condition is met
* `re`: read equal
  * `@lines = re {condition}`: read lines while the value of the condition is equal.


```
$ ni n10 p'r rl 3'
1	2	3
4	5	6
7	8	9
10
```

```bash
$ ni n10p'r rw {a < 7}'
1	2	3	4	5	6
7
8
9
10
```

```bash
$ ni n10p'r ru {a % 4 == 0}'
1	2	3
4	5	6	7
8	9	10
```

```bash
$ ni n10p'r re {int(a**2/30)}'
1	2	3	4	5
6	7
8	9
10
```


### `a_` through `l_`: Multiline Selection operations 
You have now seen two ways to generate arrays of lines: buffered readahead and data closures. In order to access data from a specific column of a line array, you will need to use multiline operators `a_` through `l_`, which are the multiline analogs to the line-based operators `a/a()` through `l/l()`.


An important thing to keep in mind when using buffered readahead with multiline reducers is that you must save. For example:

```bash
$ ni i{a..d}{x..z} F// fB. p'@lines = re {a}; r a, b_ @lines'
b	x	y	z
c	x	y	z
d	x	y	z
	x	y	z
```

* `$ ni ::data[n5] 1p'a(data)'` and `$ ni ::data[n5] 1p'a data'` will raise syntax errors, since `a/a()` are not prepared to deal with the more than one line data in the closure.
* `$ ni ::data[n5] 1p'a_ data'` works, because `a_` operates on each line.

```bash
$ ni ::data[n5] 1p'a_ data'
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Reduction via buffered readahead


```bash
$ ni 1p'cart [10, 20], [1, 2, 3]' p'sum b_ re {a}'
6
6
```

```bash
$ ni 1p'cart [10, 20], [1, 2, 3]' p'sum b_ re {a % 10}'
12
```


### `a__` through `l__`: Select-to-end-of-line
These are useful for collecting data with an unknown shape.

```bash
$ ni i[m 1 x] i[m 2 y s t] i[m 3 yo] p'r b__ rea'
1	x	2	y	s	t	3	yo
```

In particular, these operations can be used in conjunction with Hadoop streaming to join together data that have been computed separately.





## `ni`-specific Array Processors



### `min`, `max`, `minstr`, `maxstr`

Recall that text is numbers (and numbers are text) in Perl. Thus, there are two sets of methods for finding the minimum and maximum, depending on whether you want it in a numeric context (`min`, `max`) or in a string context (`minstr`, `maxstr`)




### `any`, `all`, `sum`, `prod`, `mean`

These return the logical OR of all elements, the logical AND of all elements of an array, the sum of all elements (as numbers), the product of all elements (as numbers), and their mean.

### `uniq`

This returns all of the elements of an

#### `argmax`, `argmin`

These elements

### `freqs`

This method has 

### `cart`: Cartesian Product
To generate examples for our buffered readahead, we'll take a short detour the builtin `ni` operation `cart`.

```bash
$ ni 1p'cart [10, 20], [1, 2, 3]'
10	1
10	2
10	3
20	1
20	2
20	3
```

The output of `cart` will have the first column varying the least, the second column varying the second least, etc. so that the value of the last column will change for every row if its values are all distinct.



Note that `cart` takeas array references (in square brackets), and returns array references. `ni` will interpret these array references as rows, and expand them. Thus `r`, when applied to `cart`, will likely not produce your desired results.

```
$ ni 1p'r cart [1], ["a", "b", "c"]'
ARRAY(0x7ff2bb109568)   ARRAY(0x7ff2ba8c93c8)   ARRAY(0x7ff2bb109b80)
```


## Hash Constructors

### `p'%h = <key_col><val_col>_ @lines'`: Hash constructor
Hash constructors are useful for filtering large datasets without having to invoke an expensive sort or an HDFS join. The hash constructor is also a useful demonstration of both multiline selection and begin blocks.

* Generate a list of things you want to filter, and put it in a data closure. `::ids[list_of_ids]`
* Convert the data closure to a hash using a begin block (`^{%id_hash = ab_ ids}`)
* Filter another dataset (`ids_and_data`) using the hash (`exists($id_hash{a()})`)
* `$ ni ::ids[list_of_ids] ids_and_data rp'^{%id_hash = ab_ ids} exists($id_hash{a()})'` 

### `p'%h = <key_col><val_col>S @lines'`: Accumulator hash constructor

This is useful for doing reduction on data you've already reduced; for example, you've counted the number of neighborhoods in each city in each country and now want to count the number of neighborhoods in each country.

```bash 
$ ni i[x k 3] i[x j 2] i[y m 4] i[y p 8] i[y n 1] p'r acS rea'
x	5
y	13
```

If you have ragged data, where a value may not exist for a particular column, a convience method `SNN` gives you the non-null values. See the next section for the convenience methods `kbv_dsc`.

```bash 
$ ni i[y m 4 foo] i[y p 8] i[y n 1 bar] p'%h = dcSNN rea; @sorted_keys = kbv_dsc %h; r($_, $h{$_}) for @sorted_keys''
foo	4	
bar	1
```


### `p'kbv_asc %h'` and `p'kbv_dsc %h'`: Sort hash keys by value

This is syntactic sugar for Perl's sort function applied to keys of a hash.

```bash 
$ ni i[x k 3] i[x j 2] i[y m 4] i[y p 8] i[y n 1] i[z u 0] p'r acS rea' p'r kbv_dsc(ab_ rl(3))'
y	x	z
```


```bash 
$ ni i[x k 3] i[x j 2] i[y m 4] i[y p 8] i[y n 1] i[z u 0] p'r acS rea' p'r kbv_asc(ab_ rl(3))'
z	x	y
```

## I/O Perl Functions

### `wf`: write to file

`wf $filename, @lines`: write `@lines` to a file called `$filename`

```
$ ni i[file1 1] i[file1 2] i[file2 yo] p'wf a, b_ rea'
file1
file2
$ ni file1
1
2
$ ni file2
yo
```

### `af`: append to file

```
$ ni i[file3 1] i[file3 2] i[file4 yo] i[file3 hi] p'af a, b_ rea'
file3
file4
file3
$ ni file3
1
2
hi
$ ni file4
yo
```

`af` is not highly performant; in general, if you have to write many lines to a file, you should process and sort the data in such a way that all lines can be written to the same file at once with `wf`. `wf` will blow your files away though, so be careful.


## JSON I/O

We'll spend the rest of this chapter discussing JSON and directory I/O; the former is fundamental to a lot of the types of operations that `ni` is good at, the latter will expand your understanding of `ni`'s internal workings.

### `D:<field1>,:<field2>...`: JSON Destructure

`ni` implements a very fast JSON parser that is great at pulling out string and numeric fields.  As of this writing (2017-01-16), the JSON destructurer does not support list-based fields in JSON.

### `p'json_encode <hash or array reference>`: JSON Encode

The syntax of the row to JSON instructions is similar to hash construction syntax in Ruby. 
  
```
ni //license FWpF_ p'r pl 3' \
     p'json_encode {type    => 'trigram',
                    context => {w1 => a, w2 => b},
                    word    => c}' =\>jsons \
     D:type,:word
```
### Other JSON parsing methods
Some aspects of JSON parsing are not quite there yet, so you may want to use (also very fast) raw Perl to destructure your JSONs.


## `ni` Philosophy and Style

If you've made it this far in the tutorial, you now have enough tools to be extremely productive in `ni`. If you're ready to get off the crazy ride of this tutorial and get to work, here's a great point to stop. Before you go, though, it will help to take a few minutes to think through `ni`'s philosophy and style, and how those two intersect.

### `ni` optimizes at-will programmer productivity
Many data science projects start with a request that you have never seen before; in this case, it's often easier to start from very little and be able to build rapidly, than it is to have a huge personal library of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that you can bend to fit the task at hand.

`ni` is great at generating throwaway code, and this code can be made production-ready through `ni` scripting, discussed in the next chapter.

### Mastery counts

Just because you can read a Python script and understand what it does at a basic level does not mean you can code in Python, and Python can trick very intelligent people into thinking they know what they're doing even when they don't. The opposite is true of `ni`. It will be inherently obvious when you don't know something in `ni`, because if you don't know something, it'll be likely that the part of the spell you're reading won't make sense.

This is a gruff approach to programming, but it's not unfriendly. `ni` doesn't allow you to just get by--your only option is mastering `ni` one piece at a time.

### Outsource hard jobs to more appropriate tools

`ni` is a domain-specific language; its domain is processing single lines and chunks of data that fit in memory

* Because of this philosophy, `ni` is fantastic for data munging and cleaning.
* Because of this philosophy, large-scale sorting is not a `ni`ic operation, while gzip compression is.
* Because of this philosophy, `ni` relies heavily on Hadoop for big data processing. Without Hadoop, most sufficiently complicated operations become infeasible from a runtime perspective once the amount of data exceeds a couple of gigabytes uncompressed.

Some jobs that are difficult for `ni`, and some ways to resolve them:

* Sorting
  * Challenge: Requires buffering of entire stream (possibly to disk, which is slow)
  * Solution: Hadoop Streaming will do much of the heavy lifting for you in any sort, and will distribute the computation so it's easy.
* Matrix Multiplication
  * Challenge: Difficult to implement in a streaming context
  * Solution: Numpy operations 
* SQL Joins
  * Challenge: SQL joins can take more than one line
  * Solution:
    * Small Data: There are several options here. You can use `N'...'` and do the join in numpy, you can use `N'...'` with `import pandas as pd` to do the join in pandas, or you can pipe data in and out of `join -t $'\t'`
    * Large Data: HDFS Joins
* Iterating a `ni` process over directories where the directory provides contextual information about its contents.
  * Challenge: This is something `ni` can probably do, but I'm not sure how to do it offhand.
  * Solution: Write out the `ni` spell for the critical part, embed the spell in a script written in Ruby/Python, and call it using `bash -c`.
